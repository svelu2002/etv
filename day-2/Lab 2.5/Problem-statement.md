### Case Study: Employee Hierarchy with Advanced Features

#### Problem Description:

You are tasked with designing an Employee Management System with advanced features to streamline human resources operations. The system should incorporate modular design, enhanced data modeling with records, sealed classes for employee types, and utilize enhanced pseudo-random number generators for employee ID generation.

#### Requirements:

1. **Employee Data Management:**
    - Each employee has a unique identifier, name, position, and salary.
    - Employees are categorized into different types: Regular, Manager, and Executive.

2. **Advanced Data Modeling with Records (Java 14):**
    - Utilize records for representing employee details, taking advantage of the automatic generation of methods like `equals()`, `hashCode()`, and `toString()`.

3. **Modular Design (Java 9):**
    - Design the system using the module system introduced in Java 9, separating modules for employee management, salary calculations, and data persistence.

4. **Enhanced Pseudo-Random Number Generators (Java 17):**
    - Implement enhanced pseudo-random number generators to generate unique employee identifiers during employee onboarding.

5. **Sealed Classes for Employee Types (Java 15):**
    - Introduce sealed classes for employee types (Regular, Manager, Executive) to ensure a controlled hierarchy and facilitate extensibility.

#### Implementation Steps:

1. **Module System (Java 9):**
    - Create modules for employee management, salary calculations, and data persistence.
    - Use module-info files to specify dependencies and encapsulate functionality.

2. **Record Class for Employee (Java 14):**
    - Implement a record class representing employee details (ID, name, position, salary).
    - Leverage the concise syntax and automatic methods provided by records.

3. **Enhanced Pseudo-Random Number Generators (Java 17):**
    - Apply enhanced pseudo-random number generators to generate unique employee identifiers during the employee onboarding process.

4. **Sealed Classes for Employee Types (Java 15):**
    - Introduce sealed classes for different employee types (Regular, Manager, Executive).
    - Ensure a controlled hierarchy and enhance code maintainability.


#### Benefits:

1. **Modularity:**
    - The module system ensures a modular and well-organized codebase, making it easier to manage and extend the functionality.

2. **Conciseness with Records:**
    - Leveraging records simplifies the representation of employee details, reducing boilerplate code and enhancing readability.

3. **Enhanced Pseudo-Random Number Generators:**
    - The use of enhanced pseudo-random number generators ensures the generation of unique and secure employee identifiers.

4. **Sealed Classes for Hierarchical Control:**
    - Sealed classes provide a controlled hierarchy for employee types, ensuring that the system is flexible yet maintainable.

5. **Compatibility with Latest Java Versions:**
