## Case Study: Advanced Configuration Management with Text Blocks

## Problem Statement:
Our software system relies heavily on configuration files to manage various settings, parameters, and customization options. Traditionally, configuration files are written using plain text, making them prone to errors, difficult to read, and challenging to maintain, especially when dealing with complex formatting and embedded logic.

### Requirements:
The existing configuration files lack readability, making it challenging for developers to understand and modify the settings. Additionally, some configuration parameters require embedded logic or multiline structures, such as arrays or nested objects.

### Challenges:
1. **Complex Formatting:** The current configuration files are difficult to read due to the lack of proper formatting and structure.
2. **Multiline Content:** Certain configuration parameters, like multiline descriptions or script snippets, are challenging to represent in a clear and concise manner.
3. **Embedded Logic:** Some configuration values require embedded logic or expressions, making the current format inadequate.

## Solution:

### Introduction of Text Blocks:

**Objective:**
Introduce Java text blocks to improve the readability, maintainability, and expressiveness of configuration files.

**Benefits:**
1. **Improved Readability:** Text blocks provide a natural and structured way to represent configuration parameters, enhancing readability.
2. **Simplified Multiline Content:** Handling multiline content becomes more intuitive and cleaner with text blocks, eliminating the need for awkward string concatenation.
3. **Embedded Logic Support:** Text blocks allow the inclusion of embedded expressions, facilitating the representation of dynamic or computed values within configuration files.

### Implementation Examples:

#### Traditional Configuration File (Before):
```properties
# Example Configuration File
database.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/mydatabase
database.username=admin
database.password=secretpassword
script=This is a complex script \
       that spans multiple lines \
       and requires manual concatenation.
```

#### Improved Configuration File (After - Using Text Blocks):
```java
String improvedConfigFile = """
                           # Example Configuration File
                           database.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/mydatabase
                           database.username=admin
                           database.password=secretpassword
                           script=""" + """
                           This is a complex script
                           that spans multiple lines
                           and requires no manual concatenation.
                           """;
```

### Results and Impact:

1. **Enhanced Readability:** Developers can now easily read and understand the configuration files, improving the overall maintainability of the system.
2. **Simplified Maintenance:** Configuration updates and additions become more straightforward, reducing the risk of introducing errors during modification.
3. **Embedded Logic Handling:** Text blocks allow for the inclusion of dynamic content or logic within configuration values, offering greater flexibility.

### Proposed Class: `ConfigurationManager`

### Class Structure:

```java

public class ConfigurationManager {

    
    // TODO: Implement a method to read the configuration file
    public String readConfiguration() throws IOException {
        
    }

    // TODO: Implement a method to update the configuration
    public void updateConfiguration(String updatedConfig) throws IOException {
        
    }

    // TODO: Implement a method to generate a sample configuration with embedded logic
    public String generateSampleConfiguration() {
        
    }

    // TODO: Add additional methods as needed for configuration management

    // Example of embedded logic within a text block
    private static final String SAMPLE_CONFIG = """
        # Sample Configuration
        property1=value1
        property2=value2
        property3=value3
        # Conditional property
        ${condition ? 'conditional_property=value' : ''}
        """;

    // TODO: Add methods for any other configuration-related tasks
}
```
